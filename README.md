# WiiU-SWKBD-scripts
## This method is considered obsolete in favor of Ro's Wii U custom keybord which works everywhere and is permanent. Updated Video link is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZPjN-st8o), however it imposes a brick risk if installed the wrong way. Scripts will continue to be created here for those who prefer this method, which is safer (does not involve editing critical system files)

### If you prefer to use Ro's Permament custom keyboard, Coldbootable CFW (CBHC, Tiramisu or Aroma) is a MUST since you'll need to run Sigpatches on boot time for it to work properly.
**INSTALLING RO'S CUSTOM KEYBOARD WITHOUT COLDBOOT CFW WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE!**

### Loadiine.ovh is down. If you want to use these scripts on Friends List, Miiverse or Mii Maker, use this site on your Wii U - https://55xhax.ml/

# Description
My pyGecko scripts made for interfacing with the Wii U's Software Keyboard (SWKBD), because nobody else did it yet, despite the Wii U being hackable for years.

Don't expect a ton of things here. I'll make them when I want to make them.

# What you'll need
- Python 2 or higher, Python 3 or above is recommended. A copy of pyGecko is included in each folder. 
- Any way of homebrew access on your console. Any CFW is a must if you're using these on applets. Coldboot CFW is highly recommended.
- TCPGecko on your Wii U's SD Card

# Usage Instructions
- Run with `python (script).py` (or just double click the script if you're on Windows). 
- Make sure to change the IP address at the top of the script to that of your console's IP address.

# A few things to keep in mind
- If you want to use these scripts with Mii Maker, Friends List or Miiverse, you need to modify the browser files to run exploits made for FW 5.5.1. [Guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/5-5-2-browser-with-5-5-1-vulnerability-cfw-required.480468/). If you're using these scripts on *anything* else, this isn't required.
- Most of these scripts will be intented for EUR/PAL versions of games/applets. USA and Japanese versions will come later.
- If you plan to use these scripts on **Minecraft: Wii U Edition**, please [use this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomUser-101/WiiU-SWKBD-scripts/main/Minecraft%3A%20Wii%20U%20Edition%20(EUR)/MC%20Unlock%20Symbols%20code.txt) on JGecko U or [this pyGecko script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomUser-101/WiiU-SWKBD-scripts/main/Minecraft%3A%20Wii%20U%20Edition%20(EUR)/MC_UnlockSymbols.py) to make hacked characters load properly on signs. Nintendo hacked characters will not work but things like the wide-width characters and some unicode will.




# FAQ:

### Q: When I run the script, it doesn't connect to my console, and the script closes!

A: If the script shows `Connecting to SOME.IPA.DDR.ESS:7331` and closes after a few seconds, make sure the IP address at the top of the script is set to that of your console's IP. You can get your IP address through programs like FTPiiU (Wii U) or Selfishnet (Windows). Also make sure you have the `common.py`, `common.pyc`, `tcpgecko.py` and `tcpgecko.pyc` files in the same folder as the script(s).

### Q: A folder named `__pycache__` was created! Should I be worried?

A: No, that's a folder Python creates. Don't worry about it.

### Q: I get an error that says `No module named 'tcpgecko'`!

A: Make sure the `common.py`, `common.pyc`, `tcpgecko.py` and `tcpgecko.pyc` files are in the same folder as the script(s).

### Q: The script connects and sends, but the keyboard doesn't change!

A: If you sent the script when the keyboard was open, press the Caps Lock key on the keyboard (the aâ†·A key) or close and open the keyboard. If your console is in a language other then English, try changing the keyboard to use the English keyboard (ENG option). If you haven't opened the keyboard yet, do that, then send your script. If it still doesn't change, there is a bug with the script.

Please contact me on Discord `Randm#5310` or create an Issue here if that's the case.

### Q: I've edited the script to have different keys, and the console now freezes when I send it!

A: Revert the changes you made. If this happens with unmodified scripts, contact me ASAP.

### Q: My console froze when running the exploits on 55xhax.ml!

A: If you have a slow or unstable internet connection, your console has a chance to freeze. Make sure your internet connection is fast enough and stable and try again, or alternatively, [clone this repository](https://github.com/RandomUser-101/55xhax) and host the files locally yourself using software like Apache2, nginx or HFS.

### Q: I replaced the `mvplayer.rpl` file in the browser but it freezes when I try to run TCPGecko!

A: Like other exploits that use the browser, it can freeze the console at times. If this happens, just restart your Wii U and try again.

If this keeps occuring, you most likely provided the wrong Title ID on JNUSTool. For refference, the title IDs for the browser are listed below:

##### JPN: 000500301001200A
##### USA: 000500301001210A
##### EUR: 000500301001220A

Make sure you provide the correct Title ID when downloading the MVplayer file.

If it still happens, despite replacing the proper region file, RIP.

### Q: I get an error message (no freeze) on the browser when trying to run any of the exploits!

A: The replaced `mvplayer.rpl` file was reverted back to the system default. Replace the file via FTP and try again

### Q: What does this work on?

A: This has been tested on all homebrew methods and all of them work, which currently include Haxchi, CBHC, Tiramisu and Aroma

### Q: Ro's custom keyboard freezes my console, despite me having CFW! (Tiramisu or Aroma)

A: Make sure you have the sigpatches module in the appropriate folder. If you don't have this, the console will freeze.

If you installed it without any CFW, congratulations dumbass, you've bricked.
# What keys do what

- KB1 thru KB3 = Hacked symbols and special unicode characters. 0009 is included in KB3 here (the key with the red rectangle on it) ![0009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54253840/152971588-25d92cfc-56fe-4942-98c2-2c874b365f1c.png)
- KB4 = Wide QWERTY keyboard and special unicode characters
- KB5 and KB6 = Japanese Hiragana and Katakana.

Have fun!
